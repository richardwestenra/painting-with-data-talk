		<p>London is suffering one of its worst ever cholera outbreaks. The disease has ripped through Soho, killing over 600 people, and causing many of the local residents to flee the area.</p>
		<p>At the time there were two competing theories on the cause of cholera’s spread: Some people argued that it was spread by rank-smelling air or “miasma”, that came out of rotten, decaying matter.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, others said that it was spread through some sort of unidentified microscopic organism, or “germ”. If you’ve heard of germ theory but haven’t heard of miasma theory then at this point you might have an idea which side was right, but please don’t spoil it for your neighbours if they haven't figured it out yet.</p>
		<p>Now every good story needs to have a hero, and this one is no exception. He was an English physician, and a skeptic of miasma theory. His name was John Snow.</p>

		<p>Yep that’s the guy.</p>

		<p>By chatting to local residents and studying the pattern of how the disease spread, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street - just a few minutes’ walk from my present-day office at Picadilly Circus, down in the bottom right corner of the map.</p>
		<p>John Snow tried to warn everyone about this pump, but they told him, “You know nothing John Snow”.</p>

		<p>But he was eventually able to convince the local authorities about his theory, with the aid of this dot map, which illustrates the clusters of cholera cases, juxtaposed with the locations of water pumps.</p>
		<p>You can see on the map how the infections are concentrated around the Broad Street pump, marked in blue in the middle.</p>
		<p>Once he convinced the parish authorities that almost all the deaths occurred at houses which were a shorter walking distance to the Broad Street water pump than to other pumps, they solved the problem by removing the pump handle. This forced people to draw their water from other wells which were uncontaminated, and the number of new cholera cases fell.</p>
		<p>So what does this tell us?</p>

		<p>Firstly, not to drink water from public taps in Soho. If you’re in any doubt about this, you should know that <i>not one</i> of the employees at the brewery just up the street from the pump contracted cholera. That's because they were paid in beer, so they didn’t drink the water. So if in doubt, don’t drink water, drink beer.</p>
		<p>There’s actually a pub on the location of the former pump called the John Snow, so you can drink your beer there instead if you come visit me in London.</p>

	<h2>Good charts<br> save lives 💪</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Secondly, that a well-executed chart can inspire action. John Snow’s use of a map-based dataviz helped convince the city to shut down the infected well. His chart might have saved hundreds of lives.</p>

</section>

<section>
	<h2>A good chart<br> should have a story</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		But thirdly and most importantly, it tells us that a good chart should have a story.
		<p>Most data visualization is done for the purpose of communication. We have an insight about a dataset, and we have a potential audience, and we would like to convey our insight to our audience. To communicate our insight successfully, we will have to present the audience with a clear and exciting story.</p>
		<p>The need for a story may sound a bit disturbing to engineers, who may equate it with making things up, putting a spin on things, or overselling results. After all, surely the point of a chart is to persuade people with cold hard numbers, not wishy washy emotions. However, we must not overlook the important role that stories play in reasoning and memory. We get excited when we hear a good story, and we get bored when the story is bad or when there is none.</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>What is your<br> chart's purpose?</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So when you want to make a chart, the first and most important thing to think about, is what point your chart is trying to make, or what problem you’re trying to solve.</p>
		<p>Are you trying to persuade people, and change their minds? To teach them something new? Or do you just want to make some dank chart based memes?</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Who are your audience?</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Next, consider who your audience is. Is this a dashboard that they use every day at work, or will they be random reddit users? If it's the former, then they can afford to spend more time learning to use a complex interface.</p>
		<p>You'll also want to consider their level of education and technical ability. Like are they data scientists with PhDs, or are they teenagers? How familiar are they with complex web user interfaces, or with common chart metaphors like graph axes?</p>
		<p>All of these factors will influence how much hand-holding you’ll need to do for your users. There’s often a balance or trade-off to be made, between intuitiveness on the one hand, and originality on the other.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Now, my favourite thing about charts is their ability to tell a compelling story in a beautiful way using just a few kilobytes of data and code. And just as most good storytellers use metaphors, good dataviz uses metaphors too. Like you can represent data in your visual stories with properties like position, shape, size, color, line width, and line type.</p>
		<p>All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data and those that can't.</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
	<h1 class="continuous">Continuous</h1>
	<p>vs</p>
	<h1 class="discrete"><span>D</span><span>i</span><span>s</span><span>c</span><span>r</span><span>e</span><span>t</span><span>e</span></h1>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Continuous data values are values for which arbitrarily fine intermediates exist. For example, distance is a continuous value, because you can break that down into as many intermediates as you like, from kilometres down to nanometers. On the other hand, number of persons in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 persons, or 6 persons, but not 5 and a half persons.</p>
		<p>You can use position, size, colour or line width to represent continuous data, while shape and line type should usually only be used to represent discrete data.</p>
		<p>Each of these can have advantages and disadvantages for different types of data. e.g. size can be misleading because it's tricky for the human eye to accurately tell how much bigger one thing is than another, while certain colour scales don’t work well for colour-blind people. So you’ll want to be careful how you use these scales.</p>

		<p>By the way, we've discussed static visual aesthetics but you don't have to stop there.

		<b>Every second</b><br>
		<b>8,796 photos</b><br>
		<b>are shared on Snapchat.</b>
	</p>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>In 2015, I was working with a creative team making interactive web content. And we did a piece about this hot new app called Snapchat. At the time, it was growing very quickly, and it was amazing to think there might be nearly 9 thousand photos being shared per second. We wanted to impress upon people just how many photos this was, so we visualised it by using the Snapchat logo or an emoji to represent each photo.</p>
		<p>I thought it was effective, and it did okay on Reddit, but that many photos per second was a lot for most computer’s GPUs to handle.</p>
		<p>So, predictably, the frame-rate suffered on all but the most powerful computers. Mobile phones did not handle it well at all. It was a good learning experience about performance limits on different devices.</p>
		<p>By the way, the number of Snapchats being shared these days is closer to 34 thousand per second, which would probably be enough to completely ruin the frame rate for everyone, if not completely crash your browser.</p>
		<p>So that was a fun project :). But you can also use animation in more subtle ways to communicate about your data!</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section data-id="darksky" data-background="img/dark-sky.gif" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>And this is done really well in one of my favourite apps. Dark Sky is a smartphone app that does hyper-local weather forecasting to predict exactly when it’s going to rain in the next hour, by cross-referencing your phone’s GPS against local weather radar. It’s amazing for working out whether you need to bring an umbrella when you step out for lunch. But before you all download it at once, I should warn you that unfortunately it only works in the US, UK and Ireland.</p>
		<p>Anyway Dark Sky uses an area chart to show when and how much it’ll be raining over the next hour. And the developers have included this cute little wiggle animation, which is great for communicating the level of uncertainty in the data. I think it’s really clever.</p>

		<p>So we have a few different aesthetics that we can use to represent our data. But before you start visualising it, you'll need to consider what types of data you’re going to present.</p>
		<p>You might think of data as numbers, but numerical values are only a couple of the many types of data we may encounter. In addition to continuous and discrete quantitative values, data can come in the form of discrete qualitatitive categories, or as dates or times, or as text.</p>

		<p>In order to translate your data into a visual aesthetic, you’re going to want a scale function. Scales are your basic low-level building block of any chart. They make it easy to take data of different formats, and convert it consistently into a corresponding aesthetic value, like a pixel distance or a colour or a shape.</p>
		<p>Importantly, a scale’s input and output must always have a deterministic one-to-one relationship. So for each specific data value there should be exactly one aesthetic value, and vice versa. If a scale isn’t one-to-one, then the visualization can be ambiguous.</p>

		<p>To set up a scale function, you’ll start by providing an input domain and an output range. The domain is the complete set of data values that the function can expect to receive, and the range is the set of aesthetic values that you want it to return.</p>
		<p class="meta">Move mouse to other screen</p>
		<p>So for this slide, for example, I’m using a linear colour scale to set the background colour based on the mouse position on the screen. We have a continuous numerical domain, which is based on the screen height. The input value is set to the current Y position of my mouse, as I move it around. Our output range is using the hue of an HSL colour, which goes from 0 to 360. And you can see the aesthetic output on the screen background here.</p>

	<h2>Choosing a<br> chart type</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So now it’s time to choose a chart type. There are hundreds of different established formats, and each has various advantages and disadvantages for different situations and types of data.</p>

	<h3>Don’t choose a chart type just because you think it looks cool</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>A couple of years ago, I did some work for a client project, with a team who asked us to make a bubble chart. We asked why they wanted a bubble chart specifically, and they said it’s mainly because the client likes bubble charts. You can show a lot of different dimensions at once with a bubble chart, and it’s what they’ve always used, so the client has grown to expect them. So we built it for them. And I think it ended up being a really good bubble chart, with lots of filters and animated transitions between states and so on, and the client was impressed and the team were happy. But I can’t help thinking that we were going in with one arm tied behind our backs, and that we could have chosen a chart that would have communicated so much better if we’d been allowed more flexibility to choose a chart that would suit the dataset.</p>
		<p>So above all, if you learning nothing else from this talk, I want you to learn from my mistakes, and don't do what we did on that project. Instead, remember that you should choose your chart style based on your data type, the problem you’re trying to solve, the story you’re trying to tell, and your audience.</p>

		<p>The most common choice is SVG. I spend a lot of my time working with SVG and often assume that it’s a core part of every front-end developer’s toolkit, but I meet a lot of devs who haven’t really worked with it much and don’t feel confident writing it from scratch. If this is you, that’s okay! Here’s my lightning summary of SVG:</p>

		<p>SVG is basically an alternate universe version of HTML focused on graphics instead of documents, but where everything is set to position absolute. You get some new element types like circles and polygons and lines, but you have to use a bizarro-world version of CSS which has features like stroke and fill, but you can’t use most of the regular useful features that you’d normally depend on, like background-image and border and box-shadow and so on.</p>
		<p>Also, text won’t wrap automatically which even more annoying than it sounds, so you need to use JavaScript to calculate text wrap with weird hacks like rendering to the DOM, then measuring the text width, then deleting it and re-rendering it with extra tags inserted to add line breaks, which is basically a nightmare.</p>
		<p>SVG has a DOM just like HTML, so it’s not great for JavaScript animations on large numbers of elements, but you can use CSS animations which are super performant, so I try to use those over JavaScript animations wherever possible.</p>

		<p>But if you’ve used Paint then you’ll remember that in Paint there are no layers or objects. If you draw over something then it’s gone forever. HTML Canvas is the same. Everything is raster and there’s no DOM, there’s just a big area that you need to paint onto.</p>

		<p>The native JavaScript for writing Canvas tends is a lot more imperative than writing SVG, which can make it a lot more time-consuming to work with. You also can’t inspect any DOM elements, or attach mouse events to objects, because there aren’t any. All of which makes it sound like a massive pain, which it is.</p>
		<p>But! It’s really performant for complex animations with lots of different elements. If you loaded 8000 DOM elements and animated them all with JavaScript, your frame rate would drop through the floor, but you can do it with Canvas and it’s fine.</p>

<section data-id="canvas">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p class="meta">(Press R to reset)</p>
		<p>Because there aren’t persistent objects that you can move around like you would in HTML or SVG, you need to repaint every single frame from scratch. To illustrate this, here’s an example I’ve made, which has loaded a JPG file, and is moving it a little bit every frame and drawing it again and again.</p>
		<p>If you let it run, then the canvas will fill up with old copies of the image, which would cause all sorts of performance issues if these were HTML images. But it’s Canvas so it doesn’t matter, it’s just pixels persisting until you draw over them again.</p>

		<p>But you don’t usually want to leave a trail every time you move something on screen. So usually, what you’ll do is to erase the entire canvas and redraw it again from scratch, every time you request a new animation frame.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So we’ve looked at using Canvas in a 2D context. But it also has a 3D big brother, WebGL.</p>

		<p>WebGL is basically “galaxy-brain Canvas”. Like, it is to 2D Canvas what 2D Canvas was to everything else, but even more so. If you think Canvas is performant, well WebGL is even more performant! Do you find Canvas tricky to write sometimes? Well WebGL is an absolute nightmare!</p>
		<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<section data-background-iframe="webgl.html">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p class="meta">(Controls: T = start. R = stop. Y = reset.)</p>
		<p>I've shown examples of SVG and Canvas code, so this here is a relatively straightforward example, basically a "Hello World" demo, from the Intro to WebGL tutorials on the Mozilla docs website. Let's quickly read over the code and see if we can figure out what it draws.</p>
		<p class="meta">Press T</p>
		<p>Okay so we're initialising our canvas and WebGL context, setting up some shaders for vertices, and fragments, handling lighting sources, creating some objects, and buffers, loading textures, drawing the scene... uhhh. oh no.</p>
		<p>Right, easy. Did you all get that? Anybody able to work out what it makes? The answer is a spinning cube.</p>

	<h3 class="fragment">Just because you can<br> doesn't mean you should</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>For that reason, I don't think many people actually write native WebGL code. You're better off using a library like Three.js, which is what I used to code this lovely spinning bar chart.</p>
		<p class="meta">Down 👇 to show title text</p>
		<p>I use this example to raise a very real issue with 3D charts, which is that most of the time, they're completely gratuitous and don't add anything useful. In fact by projecting data into a third dimension then representing it on a 2D screen, you're introducing visual distortion. Our eyes can try to correct for visual ambiguity, but we can only do so much.</p>
		<p>Much like all those crappy clip-art-looking 3D pie charts generated with Microsoft Excel for early 2000s Powerpoint presentations, many WebGL charts are gratuitous decoration that do nothing to help the viewer understand the data. So I'd avoid them if at all possible. The best exceptions to this rule, are visualisations of actual 3D objects, like topographical maps with mountainous terrain. But in this case, you'll still want to allow users to rotate the view, to reduce the distortion effect by providing different perspectives.</p>

		<p>HTML is great for things like simple bar charts, where you can make use of the normal document flow to arrange them, without needing to calculate each bar’s vertical offset. You already know HTML & CSS, so there’s no learning curve, and you can use CSS for animations. Also, HTML makes it easy to write semantic and accessible markup, compared to Canvas which is basically a black box.</p>
		<p>The downside of HTML is that, although there are loads of shapes and layouts that you can make with CSS, it’s ultimately not as flexible as SVG and Canvas. I’d recommend saving it for very simple things like prototypes and spark charts, and using SVG and Canvas when you have a more complex chart in mind.</p>

		<p>But this can be a tricky decision too, because there are so many charting libraries to choose from!</p>

There's a bunch that use D3 with React, like <b>Semiotic</b>, <b>Victory</b>, <b>React-Vis</b>, and <b>ReCharts</b>.

		<p>But some of you might be wondering what D3 is, and why I didn't include it in the list. D3 is a data visualisation library too, in a way. But unlike the others, it's much more low-level. It's a bit more like jQuery or Underscore than a chart library, in the sense that, rather than giving you ready-built charts or chart components that you can configure, it gives you the tools to build your own custom charts from scratch, and a set of best practices to follow.</p>
		<p>And in fact the syntax looks pretty similar to jQuery too. So if you like method chaining, you'll love it!</p>
    <p>D3 is designed to enforce separation of concerns between data and presentation, just like the web was designed to do with HTML & CSS. I know that's not a popular idea lately, what with CSS in JS and all, but I reckon it's still a useful model in the right context. Fight me.</p>

		<p>So instead of asking “which library should I use”, the real question is, “should I use D3, or another charting library”? And this one really depends on your situation, because each has a set of pros and cons.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>1. For instance, making a chart with a charting library is typically much quicker than writing something from scratch with D3. That’s the whole point: They’re an abstraction that saves you having to repeat the same basic steps every time you make a new chart.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. But when it comes to power and flexibility, that’s when D3 can really dance around the competition. It gives you full control over how things look, and has so many different tools and algorithms that you can mix and match to create really cool effects. I've been working with D3 for many years and I still regularly come across things where I'm like, whoa, D3 can do that?</p>
		<p>It also works seamlessly with existing web technologies, and can be used in conjunction with other tools and frameworks. You can manipulate any part of the DOM, or use it with SVG, Canvas, WebGL, or whatever.</p>
		<p>By contrast, most charting libraries are fairly opinionated, so they don't always do everything you want them to. If you have a specific design in mind, then the abstractions they’ve chosen may not fit your use case.</p>
		<p>I often find that it's not until I’ve nearly finished building a chart, that I discover the limitations of a given library's API, and realise that it it's not able to implement certain quirks of the design I've been given. So then I have to start all over again in something else.</p>
		<p>So what I sometimes do is make a basic prototype in a charting library, then build a more fleshed-out version in D3 once I've got more time to invest.</p>

		<p>3. But when it comes to the learning curve, that’s definitely a downside for D3. Most charting libraries are designed to be fairly easy to get started - often you just need to modify an example config, and it’s usually pretty intuitive.</p>
		<p>Whereas D3 can take a bit longer to get your head around. I found D3’s data binding and element creation especially tricky to understand when I was making my first chart with it: First, you need to create a new Selection, to select all the DOM elements on the page. But they don’t exist yet, because you haven't created them. Then you bind data to them, even though they still don’t exist. Then you ‘enter’ them, which means specifically selecting the ones that exist in the data, but not in the DOM. Then you append DOM nodes to this selection, and only then do they actually get created on the page. It makes sense once you understand why it works that way, but it did my head in.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>4. Now when it comes to performance, whether animation performance or download size, that’s a mixed bag. I’ve found that some charting libraries I've used have been a little janky at executing complex animations, but it really depends how far you’re pushing it beyond what it was designed to do. Whereas D3 is usually great for animation, and makes it surprisingly easy to do some really cool transition effects like staggered delays, and you can use CSS animations with it too.</p>
		<p>In terms of download size, it really depends on the library. If you only need one bar chart but you have to include the whole kitchen sink, that’s obviously not ideal. D3 used to be the worst culprit for this: It has dozens of different APIs, and if you import the whole thing it’s about half a megabyte unminified. But as of version 4, it's now completely modular, so you can just import the bits you want. Win.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>5. Next up, code readability and maintainability. Of course this depends on the library and on your preferences, after all code beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But I think most of us would agree that D3’s more imperative code style and chained functions are a bit more complex to understand. Which means that you need to put more thought into documenting them, and avoid writing sprawling spaghetti code. Most libraries are gonna beat D3 on this one.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>6. Finally, D3 is far more popular than any other JavaScript charting library, at least if you’re going by Github stars. It has a large community, and lots of examples, tutorials, stackoverflow questions, demos and even a few books written about it.</p>

	<h3>For prototypes and basic charts,<br> use a charting library.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>For bespoke, complex charts,<br> choose D3.</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>I know that was a lot of information for one slide, so here's a quick summary: If you just want to do a standard chart type like a bar or line chart and you're not fussy about the details, coding it in D3 will take longer than using a charting library. I'd recommend to use D3 in situations where you're trying to implement an unusual design as closely as possible.</p>

	<h1>D3 + React</h1>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>I mentioned that D3 plays well with other tools, and that includes React and other JavaScript frameworks. But when using them together, you need to make a big decision about which to use for updating the DOM.</p>
		<p>D3 is still perfectly fine to use for layout calculations even if you use React for all the DOM rendering, and in fact, out of D3's 30 different modules, 22 of them don’t have any API methods that come in direct contact with the DOM!</p>
	</aside>

<section>
  <h2>Updating the DOM</h2>
	<div class="flex">
		<div class="fragment">
			<h4>D3</h4>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Complex animation</li>
				<li>SVG helpers, e.g. axes</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="fragment">
			<h4>React</h4>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Better code structure</li>
				<li>More readable</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So it's fine if you just want to use React, but they're both great for DOM rendering in their own separate ways, and each have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>1. Like D3 is amazing at handling animations, and has some really useful SVG helpers for tricky things like axes.</p>
		<p class="meta">DOWN</p>
		<p>2. But D3 code tends to make your chart less structured, by putting the whole chart in one component, which can lead to tight-coupling between the individual parts. It's also a bit less readable than React's declarative syntax.</p>
		<p>It's a pretty tough call! I like the structure and readability that comes by using React components, but I also like using the transitions directly on the DOM elements.</p>
	</aside>

<section data-background="img/why-not-both.gif" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So why not choose a hybrid approach? What I like to do is to combine both approaches: Let React render static components, but use D3 for axes, and anything that needs complex animations. You can mix and match the syntax together, and see what works for you.</p>
		<p class="meta">Slow</p>
		<p>If you want to use D3 for DOM rendering in a React component, you just need to pass a container ref to your D3 code, and run it in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. There's a great article by Elijah Meeks with more details, which I've added a link to at the end of this slide deck.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
		<p>Finally, you don't have to use your new D3, SVG and Canvas knowledge for just making charts. D3 is not just a data visualisation library! It's also a data analysis library, a data formatting library, an SVG shape library, an animation library, and a DOM manipulation library.</p>
		<p>It has dozens of different modules and algorithms to play with, and you can get really creative with them, and mix and match different layouts and scaling functions to create interesting effects in different contexts. They're great for adding playful flourishes to your websites, or talk slides.</p>
