		<p>Hi, my name is Richard, and I’m here today to talk to you about what is best in life.</p>
		<p>About my background: I started out at university studying engineering, and I hated it. I quickly switched to a philosophy degree, which I loved. Now, ten years later, my job title is front end engineer. I guess engineering isn't so bad after all?</p>

		<p>I’ve now been coming to FEL regularly for about four years, but this is my first time getting up on stage. When I first started coming, I was a bit too nervous to actually talk to anyone in the pub, so I’d just go straight home after the talks.</p>
		<p>But over time I started actually talking to people, and it’s become a big part of my life in London. I’ve met some close friends here. I found a new coworker here. I learned about the codebar community here, and now I’m an organiser there, and you should totally come join us! And I got my current job through the FEL slack group, which you should also totally join! (Patrick, you’re welcome). And none of that would have happened without FEL, so, thanks Made by Many!</p>

		<p>Actually, it's about ethics in software engineering.</p>
		<p>I mentioned that my official job title these days is front-end engineer, though I usually refer to myself as a developer. I've always felt a bit uncomfortable with the title of engineer, though I couldn't really put my finger on why. Maybe it felt a bit like I was claiming some sort of prestige that I hadn't earned?</p>
		<p>I didn't complete my engineering degree, and I didn't study computer science: I'm mostly self-taught. I think I’m pretty good at my job, but I still feel like I'm basically hacking stuff together a lot of the time.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, we who build websites used to call ourselves webmasters - which I still think is an amazing job title. I'm kinda sad that I didn't start my career early enough to have a webmaster role in the job history section of my CV.</p>
		<p>Anyway, we were webmasters, then we were web developers, and now a lot of us are front-end engineers.</p>
		<p>I don’t think that's a bad thing, or that we should stop calling ourselves engineers - call yourself whatever you want, you can be a techno-viking or an agile pirate-ninja riding a full-stack glitter-unicorn if it makes you feel better.</p>

		<p>But a lot of us are self-taught and didn't go through any standardised training process. And don't get me wrong, this is great, it helps ease barriers to entry. But as the industry gets more professional, it might be worth thinking about other trappings of professionalism. If we're going to call ourselves engineers, then there are ethical duties and codes of responsibility that go along with that title.</p>

		<p>A hundred years ago, civil engineering was in a similar situation to how the tech industry is now. As the industrial revolution receded behind them, engineers found new ways to use all the fancy new technologies they had developed. They grew more sophisticated in their approach, and their projects were grew in scale and complexity.</p>
		<p>But as these projects became more ambitious, there was an accompanying problem: A rise in major engineering disasters. The turn of the twentieth century saw a wave of epic structural failures, including some massive bridge collapses, <em>and also the Great Boston Molasses Flood, which you can see here</em>.</p>

		<p>Which, if I had to name my favourite disaster of all time, this would have to be it, just for the mental image of a tsunami of liquid sugar 50 feet high, consuming everything in its path. It's terrifying, but also, kinda delicious?</p>
		<p>Anyway these disasters had a profound effect on the way the public saw engineering, and forced engineers to confront their shortcomings.</p>
		<p>As a result, they began to regulate themselves more intensely, and established standardised codes of ethics.</p>

		<p>Philosophers like to do things called "thought experiments", which are like real experiments but even better, because you never need to get out of your armchair.</p>
		<p>One of the most famous is the trolley problem. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with it, but for those who aren't, here's the deal.</p>

		<p>There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:</p>
		<p>Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.</p>
		<p>Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.</p>
		<p>Which is the most ethical choice? Quick show of hands, no wrong answers.</p>

<section data-background="img/fat-man.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">

		<p>Now, imagine instead of a switch, you’re standing on a bridge over the tracks, next to an extremely large man. The trolley is coming, and the only way you can stop it is to push the large man onto the tracks. He’s the only one big enough to slow down the trolley.</p>
		<p>He’s looking you right in the eyes, he can see what you’re thinking, and he’s terrified, begging you not to do it. What do you do?</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys, which tend to find that approximately 9 out of 10 respondents would throw the switch to kill the one and save the five.</p>
		<p>However in the large man scenario, the situation reverses, and only 1 in 10 people would push him onto the tracks.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, a 2009 survey of professional philosophers found that only 68% of them would throw the switch, 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer. So if you’re ever tied to a train track by a cartoon villain, you’d better hope that the person by the switch isn’t a moral philosopher.</p>
		<p>So why the difference in the two outcomes?</p>

<section data-background="img/brain.gif" data-background-size="cover">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>One theory is that it's because two different parts of your brain are fighting with each other.</p>
		<p>Some researchers looked at people’s brains using fMRI machines, and demonstrated that "personal" dilemmas (like pushing a man off a footbridge) engage brain regions associated with emotion, whereas "impersonal" dilemmas (like diverting the trolley by flipping a switch) engaged regions associated with controlled reasoning.</p>
		<p>And these different brain processes essentially compete with each other whenever you have to make a tough moral decision.</p>

</section>
<section data-background="img/mvr.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Basically, inside your brain, you’ve got a monkey and a robot fighting over the controls. Every time you have to make a moral decision, they duke it out.</p>
		<p>The monkey understands something simple like pushing someone off a bridge, and it's horrified. But it doesn't understand something complex like a mechanical switch, so in that situation, the gut response is reduced, and we're able to throw the lever without feeling such a crushing sense of moral horror.</p>
		<p>Now some people have a stronger monkey, and some people have a stronger robot, and that's great, because both are useful in different situations.</p>
		<p>But this is tricky for we programmers, because we work on complex problems, which might make it trickier for our monkey brains to trigger some kinds of moral responses.</p>

		<p>By the way, if you think it's hard for programmers to experience the full range of ethical response, then spare a thought for autonomous vehicles.</p>
		<p>Self-driving cars don’t have meat brains, and you can’t make a perfectly ethical algorithm: You can only make it as good as the humans who programmed it, and we can’t even agree on whether to use tabs or spaces.</p>

		<p>There are also some really tricky problems here that self-driving cars will face. Like, we'd prefer a self-driving car to swerve into a pile of trash rather than hit someone, just like a person might. But computers can make these kinds of decisions much quicker than we can, so if we decide in advance what we want them to do, they'll follow our instructions.</p>
		<p>So, we'd probably want to program our car to hit a single adult rather than bus-load of school children, right? But what if the adult is a Nobel-prize winning cancer researcher? What if the adult is driving the car? Would we want the car to sacrifice its driver? And would you choose to buy a self-driving car that's designed to sacrifice your life to save others?</p>

		<p>Some researchers at MIT came up with a nice solution for this: They built an app to mine data on people’s answers to different trolley problems, so they can use it to help them decide how autonomous cars should behave in different scenarios.</p>
		<p>The website is called Moral Machine, and you can go there right now and start judging scenarios, to help guide the self-driving cars of the future. I mean, maybe wait until the break, ok?</p>
		<p>But that doesn't help us, because we can't outsource all our moral decision-making to the internet. We're just individuals working away at computers we don't understand, and we have these ridiculous meat brains, and we have to make ethical decisions.</p>

			<p>Btw, on the subject of security: A basic dilemma in engineering ethics is that an engineer has a duty their client or employer, but an even greater duty to report a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions.</p>
			<p>A classic example of this is the Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster. NASA engineers raised warnings about faulty O-rings in the boosters, and the dangers posed by the low temperatures on the morning of the launch, but managers disregarded these warnings, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.</p>

			<p>So for example, if you're considerig being lazy about making your website accessible, imagine there's a disabled person sitting next to you, and think about whether you'd feel comfortable explaining your code choices to them.</p>
			<p>The second one seems designed to trigger more of a consequentialist response. It's maybe a bit of a rationalist, robot-brained approach?</p>

			<p>A few years ago, I was working for an consultancy, who assigned me to a website project for a client I didn't approve of. But I got so invested in solving the technical aspects of the project, that I didn't stop to think about whether I was morally okay with working for this client, until I was already deeply invested. I moaned about the client to some colleagues, and they told me, if you didn't want to work for this client, that's fine, but you should have said something at the start of this project.</p>
			<p>It made me realise that it was okay to say no to client projects, but also that the appropriate time to do that is before you start work. The later you leave it, the harder it is to say no.</p>
			<p>The next time a dodgy client came along, I felt more comfortable expressing my concerns up-front, and we ended up turning down the client.</p>
